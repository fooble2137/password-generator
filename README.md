# Password Generator

A password generator created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to help you create secure passwords for your online accounts. This customisable tool allows you to adjust the password length and select the character types to include, such as uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. This enables you to create passwords that meet your specific security requirements, making it easier to protect your accounts from unauthorised access. The generator instantly produces a random password based on your preferences, which you can then copy and use wherever needed. This tool is particularly effective in enhancing digital security by promoting the use of complex, unique passwords.
